# MicrosoftTeamsSingleUserUninstall
Uninstall single user instances of Microsoft Teams fully

This script was created after I was tasked with removing single user instances of Microsoft Teams and noticing that after running the recommended script from Microsoft that Teams in the web browser sometimes would cease to function as intended.  This script is a copy of what I used in PDQ Deploy to uninstall Teams silently and remove residual files.
